### Introduction
Twitter is one of the largest microblogging social network of this decade and CEOs are increasingly flocking to this site. Who can blame them, given that this is where all the action happens - the latest news of the companies, marketing and leadership. Whether you are the CEO of a Fortune 100 company or a small business owner, your Tweets matter and it is an effective way to strengthen ties with the customers, build your brand image, network with influencers and crowdsource to learn and improve on products and services.

In this project, we analyze the tweets of various CEOs and try to ascertain the characteristics and tweeting styles that make them influential. We also look into customer engagement based on these tweets, and what topics help the company build their brand presence. We tie it all together by looking at whether these tweets offer any support for increased success in the companyâ€™s economic value.
